Title: Approximate Bayesian Computation for EpiModel on High-Performance Computing Clusters
Description: Implementation of Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential 
    Monte Carlo Methods (ABC-SMC) optimized for use with EpiModel R package epidemic
    simulations running on High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environments such
    as MPI and Slurm.
Author: Samuel Jenness, with original ABC-SMC statistical algorithms based on the 
            EasyABC R package developed by Franck Jabot, Thierry Faure, Nicolas Dumoulin, 
            and Carlo Albert.
