Title: Approximate Bayesian Computation for EpiModel on High-Performance Computing Clusters
Description: Implementation of Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo
    Methods (ABC-SMC) optimized for use with EpiModel R package epidemic simulations
    running on High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environments such as MPI
    and Slurm. This package uses AMC-SMC algorithms originally developed for the
    EasyABC R package.
Author: Samuel Jenness, with original ABC-SMC statistical algorithms based on the 
            EasyABC R package (authors: Franck Jabot, Thierry Faure, Nicolas Dumoulin, 
            and Carlo Albert).
