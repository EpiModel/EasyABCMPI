Implementation of Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo Methods (ABC-SMC) optimized for use with EpiModel R package epidemic simulations running on High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster environments such as MPI and Slurm. This package uses AMC-SMC algorithms originally developed for the EasyABC R package.
